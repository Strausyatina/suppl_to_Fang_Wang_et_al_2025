R scripts required to reproduce gene ontology enrichment calculations and visualization:
- GO_enrichment.R: calculates GO enrichment results using clusterProfiler and edgeR results tables as input
- GOprocess_heatmap.R: reproduces the gene expression heatmap for GO process "regulation of lipid metabolic process" in GV oocytes using GO enrichment results and CPM counts for GV oocytes
R session info files:
- GO_sessionInfo.txt: R sessionInfo for GO_enrichment.R
- GOprocess_heatmap_sessionInfo.txt: R sessionInfo for GOprocess_heatmap.R
